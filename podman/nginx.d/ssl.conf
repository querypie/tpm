## Configuring TLS Certificates for HTTPS
##
## Steps:
##
## 1. Place the TLS certificates provided by the customer into the `certs/` directory.
##    - Include two files in PEM format: the Full Chain Certificate and the Private Key.
##
## 2. In this `ssl.conf` file, reference the certificate files stored in the `certs/` directory.
##    - Set `ssl_certificate` to the filename of the Full Chain Certificate.
##    - Set `ssl_certificate_key` to the filename of the Private Key.
##
## 3. Reload the nginx configuration to apply the changes.
##    - First, verify that the configuration file is valid:
##      `docker exec -it querypie-app-1 nginx -t`
##    - Then reload nginx to apply the updated configuration:
##      `docker exec -it querypie-app-1 nginx -s reload`
##
## 4. HTTPS should now be accessible via: https://QUERYPIE_WEB_URL/
##
## Note:
## Based on the `docker-compose.yml` configuration,
## the `certs/` directory is volume-mounted to `/app/certs/` inside the container.

# ssl_certificate     /app/certs/querypie.customer.com.crt;
# ssl_certificate_key /app/certs/querypie.customer.com.key;
